        "# Multi-Agent Financial Analysis System\n",
        "\n",
        "This project presents a Multi-Agent Financial Analysis System powered by Agentic AI, designed to emulate the complex, end-to-end analytical workflows used in modern investment firms. Unlike traditional static pipelines, this system leverages a network of autonomous, specialized AI agents that can reason, plan, act, and collaborate dynamically to perform financial analysis with minimal human intervention.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Agentic AI represents the next evolution in automation—moving beyond linear, rule-based logic to adaptive intelligence that can self-organize, self-critique, and iteratively improve. In this architecture, multiple agents, each with distinct expertise such as data retrieval, financial modeling, sentiment analysis, and investment evaluation—coordinate through a shared reasoning framework. This enables the system to handle real-world financial tasks such as parsing earnings reports, analyzing market news, comparing valuation metrics, and generating investment insights.  \n",
        "\n",
        "By integrating reasoning, planning, and autonomous coordination, the system mirrors the workflows of professional analysts and research teams. It can:\n",
        "- Retrieve and process live financial data and news.\n",
        "- Conduct structured equity and portfolio analyses.\n",
        "- Evaluate company fundamentals and generate insights.\n",
        "- Critique and refine its own outputs for improved accuracy.  \n",
        "- Review the final summary using another grador agent.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Ultimately, this project demonstrates how Agentic AI architectures can transform traditional financial analysis into a collaborative, intelligent ecosystem that scales analytical reasoning, enhances decision quality, and adapts continuously to new market conditions.\n",

        "\n",
        "The `ToolboxAgent` provides a **centralized toolkit for fetching and caching financial data** from multiple sources.  \n",
        "It acts as the **data retrieval layer** in the multi-agent financial system, enabling other agents to access structured information efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Core Functionality**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialization**\n",
        "   - Sets up API clients for:\n",
        "     - **Yahoo Finance** (`yfinance`)  \n",
        "     - **NewsAPI** (`newsapi`)  \n",
        "     - **Federal Reserve Economic Data** (`FRED`)  \n",
        "     - **SEC EDGAR Filings** (`sec_api`)  \n",
        "   - Maintains an internal **cache** to store fetched data for 24 hours, reducing redundant requests.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Caching**\n",
        "   - `_is_cache_valid(symbol, tool_name)` checks if cached data is still fresh.  \n",
        "   - Automatically returns cached results if valid.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Logging**\n",
        "   - `_get_logger(state)` attaches an `AgentLogger` to track data fetching events, errors, and cache hits.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Tool Methods**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`get_yahoo_finance_data(symbol, state)`**  \n",
        "  Fetches stock price, P/E ratio, and other fundamental metrics from Yahoo Finance.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`get_financial_news(symbol, state)`**  \n",
        "  Retrieves the most recent relevant news articles for a given symbol using NewsAPI.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`get_economic_data(indicator, state)`**  \n",

        "\n",
        "- **`get_filing_data(indicator, state)`**  \n",
        "  Retrieves SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, SC 13D/G) for a company, downloads documents, and caches the content locally.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`fetch(tool_name, symbol, state)`**  \n",
        "  Dynamically dispatches requests to the appropriate tool method based on `tool_name`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Purpose**\n",
        "The `ToolboxAgent` enables **reliable, centralized access to diverse financial data sources** with:\n",
        "- Automatic **caching** for efficiency  \n",
        "- **Structured logging** for traceability  \n",
        "- **Support for multiple data types** (stock metrics, news, economic indicators, filings)  \n",

        "     - **Ollama LLaMA2** as fallback.  \n",
        "   - Initializes a **sentence embedding model** (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) for semantic similarity calculations.  \n",

        "\n",
        "2. **`llm_grade(thesis, reference)`**\n",
        "   - Evaluates an investment thesis for:\n",

        "   - Returns the LLM-generated evaluation and justification.  \n",
        "   - Falls back to Ollama if OpenAI evaluation fails.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **`embedding_consistency(thesis_a, thesis_b)`**\n",
        "   - Computes the **semantic similarity** between two theses using sentence embeddings.  \n",

The company exhibits robust financial performance and maintains strong market sentiment. However, its relatively high valuation and identified risks require a more cautious approach. While the mean analyst target price suggests potential upside, the target price variance and market saturation necessitate a neutral stance, awaiting further catalysts for significant growth.\\n\\n**1. Company Overview:**\\n\\n*   Apple Inc., headquartered in Cupertino, California, operates in the technology sector, specializing in consumer electronics, software, and online services.\\n*   On October 16, 2025, Apple Inc. (formerly \\\"Usual Stablecoin\\\") completed a restructuring of divisions to align strategic business units for increased focus, innovation and profitability.\\n*   The company's Investor Relations website is: http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=116466&p=irol-IRHome\\n*   First trade date was in 1980 (as Apple Computer Inc.), indicating a long history and established market presence.\\n\\n**2. Financial Performance Analysis (Data as of November 5, 2025):**\\n\\n*   **Revenue Growth:** Apple's reported annual revenue for fiscal year 2025 was \\\\$383.29 billion USD, a 2.8% increase from \\\\$374.39 billion in 2024 (Source: Apple's 2025 10-K filing). This indicates consistent, albeit moderate, revenue growth for a company of its size.\\n*   **Profitability:**\\n    *   Net Income to Common: \\\\$96.995 Billion USD (Source: Apple's 2025 10-K filing).

This confirms a premium valuation, in line with industry peers.\\n    *   Enterprise Value to Revenue: 7.76 (Calculated using Enterprise Value of \\\\$2.97 Trillion and Annual Revenue of \\\\$383.29 Billion).\\n*   **Dividend:** Pays a dividend with a yield of 0.53% (Source: Yahoo Finance), making it a minor component of total return.\\n*   **Split:** Last split date was 8/31/2020 at 4:1. Historical stock splits should be considered when analyzing long-term price trends.\\n\\n**3. Market Performance and Sentiment (Data as of November 5, 2025):**\\n\\n*   **Current Price:** \\\\$193.32\\n*   **52-Week Performance:**\\n    *   Change from 52-Week Low: +42.59%\\n    *   52-Week Change: +29.85%\\n    *   Outperformance vs. S&P 500: Apple's 52-week change of 29.85% outperforms the S&P 500's 16.42% change during the same period (Source: Yahoo Finance), demonstrating relative strength.\\n*   **Technical Indicators:**\\n    *   50-Day Average Change: +3.12%\\n    *   200-Day Average Change: +27.78%\\n*   **Analyst Ratings:**\\n    *   Average Analyst Rating: 2.2 (Buy) (Source: MarketWatch, based on 35 analysts).

Management and Governance:**\\n\\n*   **Key Executives:**\\n    *   Tim Cook (Chief Executive Officer)\\n    *   Luca Maestri (Chief Financial Officer)\\n    *   Katherine Adams (Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Senior Vice President, Legal and Global Security)\\n*   Executive Compensation details available in Apple's proxy statements filed with the SEC.\\n\\n**5. Key Strengths:**\\n\\n*   **Strong Brand Recognition and Customer Loyalty:** Apple's brand is globally recognized and commands a high level of customer loyalty, creating a competitive advantage.\\n*   **Ecosystem Integration:** Apple's hardware, software, and services are tightly integrated, enhancing user experience and creating switching costs.\\n*   **Consistent Financial Performance:** Demonstrated by consistent revenue and profitability, driven by strong product sales and growing services revenue.\\n*   **Innovation:** Apple continues to invest in R&D and introduce innovative products and services, maintaining its position at the forefront of technology.\\n*   **Services Growth:**  Apple's services segment (Apple Music, iCloud, Apple TV+, etc.) is experiencing significant growth, providing recurring revenue streams and diversifying its business.\\n\\n**6. Weaknesses/Risks:**\\n\\n*   **High Valuation:** The elevated price-to-earnings and enterprise value multiples suggest that the stock is trading at a premium.\\n*   **Target Price Variance:** The wide range between the target high and low prices (\\\\$275 vs. \\\\$160) reflects uncertainty among analysts regarding future growth prospects.\\n*   **Dependence on iPhone Sales:** While diversifying, Apple remains heavily reliant on iPhone sales, making it vulnerable to market saturation and competition in the smartphone market.\\n*   **Regulatory Scrutiny:** Apple faces increasing regulatory scrutiny regarding its App Store policies, data privacy practices, and potential anti-competitive behavior, which could lead to fines or changes in its business model.\\n*   **Supply Chain Disruptions:** Global supply chain disruptions can impact Apple's ability to meet demand, affecting revenue and profitability. Competition with Android is fierce, eroding the Apple market share in the cell phone market.\\n\\n**7. Growth Opportunities:**\\n\\n*   **Expansion in Emerging Markets:** Apple has opportunities to expand its presence in emerging markets, targeting a new customer base.\\n*   **Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR):** Apple is investing heavily in AR/VR technology, potentially creating new product categories and revenue streams.\\n*   **Healthcare:** Apple is expanding its presence in the healthcare market through its Apple Watch and other health-related initiatives.\\n*   **Services Expansion:** Continued growth in its services segment, driven by new offerings and increased subscription adoption.\\n*   **Automotive:** Entry into the automotive market presents potential high-growth revenue stream.\\n\\n**8. Investment Thesis:**\\n\\nThe **HOLD** recommendation is based on a balanced assessment of Apple's strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities. While the company boasts strong financial performance, brand recognition, and growth prospects in various sectors, its high valuation and identified risks warrant a neutral stance. The wide analyst target price range further reflects uncertainty, and the company faces potential headwinds from regulatory scrutiny and competitive pressures. A \\\"Hold\\\" rating allows investors to maintain their position while awaiting clearer signals of sustained growth and reduced risk factors before considering further investment.\\n\\n**Target Price:** The target price is set at \\\\$220, aligning with the median analyst target, providing a realistic view.\\n\\n**Investment Horizon:** 12-18 months.\\n\\n**9.

            "\n",
            "**1. Factual Consistency:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Current Price:** Requires verification based on the precise time the analysis was written (October 26, 2023). It's impossible to confirm without accessing historical data for that specific date.\n",
            "*   **Target Price:** The $218.51 target price needs verification against analyst consensus at the time.  Which source was used for the average analyst target?  Bloomberg? FactSet?  Simply stating \"based on analyst mean\" is insufficient.\n",
            "*   **Forward EPS of $4.12 and Trailing EPS of $3.52:**  These numbers require sourcing. What fiscal year are these referring to? Are these GAAP or non-GAAP?\n",
            "*   **Estimated EPS for the current year is $4.50986:** Extremely precise EPS estimate. Where does this number come from?  It's highly suspect without a source and appears artificially precise.\n",
            "*   **Net Income of $86.6 Billion:** **This is incorrect and highly problematic.** NVIDIA's net income has never been close to this figure. This is a major factual error that undermines the entire analysis. This number requires immediate correction and verification from a reliable source like NVIDIA's SEC filings or reputable financial data providers. NVIDIA's total revenue for fiscal year 2023 (ending January 2023) was $27 Billion.\n",
            "*   **Analyst Rating of \"1.3 - Strong Buy\":** Requires defining the scale used for analyst ratings. Is 1.0 a Strong Buy and 5.0 a Strong Sell? It requires verification of the rating scale, and confirmation it is the average.\n",
            "*   **Last dividend value is small ($0.01):** Needs context. Is this per quarter? Annually? Per share?\n",
            "*   **Stock Split (10:1 on 1717977600 timestamp):** The stock split happened on June 10, 2024, not on timestamp 1717977600 (which translates to May 14, 2024, at midnight UTC.) . This needs to be changed to the accurate date.\n",
            "*   **52-Week Change:** These percentages require verification against the precise date of the analysis (October 26, 2023).  The S&P 500 data is especially time-sensitive.\n",
            "\n",
            "**2. Logical Consistency:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **\"Strong Buy\" Justification vs. Risks:** While the report lists several impressive growth drivers, the \"Strong Buy\" recommendation seems overly aggressive given the identified risks. The risks are presented in a somewhat perfunctory manner. Are there any strategies to mitigate these risks? For example, if geopolitical risks are a concern, how diversified is NVIDIA's supply chain? Or, given the competition, does NVIDIA have any unique technology (patents, closed-source software) that ensures a long-term competitive edge? The link between the analysis of risk factors, and the recommendation, is inadequate. The risks aren't sufficiently \"priced in\" to the analysis.\n",
            "*   **Dependence on Specific Industries:** The draft mentions dependence on key industries, but doesn't quantify or explore it adequately. If gaming is a major revenue source and gaming is cyclical, how is NVIDIA mitigating this risk?\n",
            "*   **Valuation Argument:** The analysis claims a \"reasonable valuation,\" but the provided metrics (P/E, PEG) are only helpful with benchmarks and deeper comparison against peers. The PEG ratio of 1.00 is based on *historical* growth. Is it reasonable to assume that NVIDIA can maintain that growth rate going forward? The report doesn't address this critical point.\n",
            "*   **Catalysts:** The catalysts are generic. \"Continued Growth in AI Adoption\" is not a specific catalyst; it's a general trend. A more effective catalyst would be a specific event or product launch.\n",
            "\n",
            "**3. Suggestion for Refinement:**\n",
            "\n",
            "**The single most important refinement is to *prioritize risk assessment and mitigation strategies*.** The report needs to:\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Quantify the Risks:**  Where possible, quantify the impact of each risk. For example, what percentage of revenue is dependent on the gaming sector? What would be the impact of a 10% decline in gaming revenue?\n",
            "*   **Provide Mitigation Strategies:** For each significant risk, explicitly discuss how NVIDIA is mitigating it (or planning to mitigate it).  Supply chain diversification, R&D leadership, long-term contracts, etc.\n",
            "*   **Stress Test the Valuation:**  Run a sensitivity analysis on the valuation based on different scenarios. What happens to the target price if EPS growth slows down? What happens if competition intensifies?\n",
            "*   **Adjust the Recommendation (Potentially):**  Based on the revised risk assessment, the \"Strong Buy\" recommendation might need to be toned down to a \"Buy\" or even a \"Hold.\" The recommendation should be a direct output of a risk-adjusted analysis, rather than a pre-determined conclusion. The overall model needs to be revisited to incorporate some of these considerations.\n",
            "\n",
            "By focusing on a more rigorous and honest assessment of the risks, the investment analysis will be significantly more credible and useful.  The identification and correction of the factual errors is of paramount importance, though.\n",
