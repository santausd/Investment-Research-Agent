        "# Multi-Agent Financial Analysis System\n",
        "\n",
        "This project presents a Multi-Agent Financial Analysis System powered by Agentic AI, designed to emulate the complex, end-to-end analytical workflows used in modern investment firms. Unlike traditional static pipelines, this system leverages a network of autonomous, specialized AI agents that can reason, plan, act, and collaborate dynamically to perform financial analysis with minimal human intervention.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Agentic AI represents the next evolution in automation—moving beyond linear, rule-based logic to adaptive intelligence that can self-organize, self-critique, and iteratively improve. In this architecture, multiple agents, each with distinct expertise such as data retrieval, financial modeling, sentiment analysis, and investment evaluation—coordinate through a shared reasoning framework. This enables the system to handle real-world financial tasks such as parsing earnings reports, analyzing market news, comparing valuation metrics, and generating investment insights.  \n",
        "\n",
        "By integrating reasoning, planning, and autonomous coordination, the system mirrors the workflows of professional analysts and research teams. It can:\n",
        "- Retrieve and process live financial data and news.\n",
        "- Conduct structured equity and portfolio analyses.\n",
        "- Evaluate company fundamentals and generate insights.\n",
        "- Critique and refine its own outputs for improved accuracy.  \n",
        "- Review the final summary using another grador agent.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Ultimately, this project demonstrates how Agentic AI architectures can transform traditional financial analysis into a collaborative, intelligent ecosystem that scales analytical reasoning, enhances decision quality, and adapts continuously to new market conditions."

        "\n",
        "The `ToolboxAgent` provides a **centralized toolkit for fetching and caching financial data** from multiple sources.  \n",
        "It acts as the **data retrieval layer** in the multi-agent financial system, enabling other agents to access structured information efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Core Functionality**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialization**\n",
        "   - Sets up API clients for:\n",
        "     - **Yahoo Finance** (`yfinance`)  \n",
        "     - **NewsAPI** (`newsapi`)  \n",
        "     - **Federal Reserve Economic Data** (`FRED`)  \n",
        "     - **SEC EDGAR Filings** (`sec_api`)  \n",
        "   - Maintains an internal **cache** to store fetched data for 24 hours, reducing redundant requests.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Caching**\n",
        "   - `_is_cache_valid(symbol, tool_name)` checks if cached data is still fresh.  \n",
        "   - Automatically returns cached results if valid.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Logging**\n",
        "   - `_get_logger(state)` attaches an `AgentLogger` to track data fetching events, errors, and cache hits.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Tool Methods**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`get_yahoo_finance_data(symbol, state)`**  \n",
        "  Fetches stock price, P/E ratio, and other fundamental metrics from Yahoo Finance.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`get_financial_news(symbol, state)`**  \n",

        "\n",
        "- **`get_economic_data(indicator, state)`**  \n",

        "\n",
        "- **`get_filing_data(indicator, state)`**  \n",
        "  Retrieves SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, SC 13D/G) for a company, downloads documents, and caches the content locally.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`fetch(tool_name, symbol, state)`**  \n",
        "  Dynamically dispatches requests to the appropriate tool method based on `tool_name`.\n",

        "The `ToolboxAgent` enables **reliable, centralized access to diverse financial data sources** with:\n",
        "- Automatic **caching** for efficiency  \n",
        "- **Structured logging** for traceability  \n",
        "- **Support for multiple data types** (stock metrics, news, economic indicators, filings)  \n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Initialization**\n",
        "   - Sets up LLM evaluation clients:\n",
        "     - **OpenAI GPT-4o** if `OPENAI_API_KEY` is available.  \n",
        "     - **Ollama LLaMA2** as fallback.  \n",
        "   - Initializes a **sentence embedding model** (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) for semantic similarity calculations.  \n",
        "   - Prints the active evaluation mode (`OPENAI` or `OLLAMA`).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **`llm_grade(thesis, reference)`**\n",
        "   - Evaluates an investment thesis for:\n",
        "     - **Clarity**  \n",
        "     - **Factual accuracy**  \n",
        "     - **Rigor**  \n",
        "   - Accepts an optional reference for comparison.  \n",
        "   - Returns the LLM-generated evaluation and justification.  \n",
        "   - Falls back to Ollama if OpenAI evaluation fails.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **`embedding_consistency(thesis_a, thesis_b)`**\n",
        "   - Computes the **semantic similarity** between two theses using sentence embeddings.  \n",
        "   - Returns a cosine similarity score between 0 and 1, indicating consistency of analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **`coordination_efficiency(logs)`**\n",

            "*   **Market Cap:** The statement \"Market Cap: (Calculated: Based on price and available EPS: Approximately $4.5 Trillion ) - *Requires accurate share outstanding data for precise calculation.*\" is potentially inconsistent.  You *cannot* calculate market cap from price and EPS alone. Market Cap = Share Price * Shares Outstanding.  The $4.5 Trillion is likely an estimate based on current share price x current outstanding share, which would fluctuate.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Net Income:** Net income of $86.597 Billion seems very high and requires verification. This number should be cross-referenced with NVIDIA's most recent financial statements. It is highly unlikely that NVIDIA has a net income that is that high as of November 2024. This will skew the calculation for trailing EPS.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Trailing EPS:** The EPS of $3.52 may or may not be consistent with actual share price, net income, and shares outstanding.\n",

            "*   **Dividend Yield:** The dividend yield calculation is correct *given* the $0.01 dividend value, however, it is misleading as NVIDIA has a small dividend value.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **PEG Ratio:** A PEG ratio of 1.00 may or may not be correct.\n",

            "*   **Recommendation vs. Risks:** The \"HOLD\" recommendation is *weakly* supported by the risks. The analysis highlights *significant* valuation concerns (high Enterprise-to-Revenue and Enterprise-to-EBITDA) that should weigh more heavily. A \"HOLD\" implies neutral sentiment, but the valuation risk suggests a potential \"UNDERPERFORM\" or \"REDUCE\" recommendation might be more appropriate, *unless* the analyst believes the growth prospects *completely* justify the valuation, and this conviction is *clearly explained*.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **PEG Ratio and Valuation:** The assessment of the PEG ratio as \"fair value\" is problematic. A PEG ratio of 1 *suggests* fair value *if* the growth rate is sustainable and accurately reflects future prospects. However, it shouldn't be taken in isolation, especially when other valuation metrics are flashing red. You need to justify why you're giving more weight to the PEG ratio than the Enterprise Value ratios.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Growth Drivers and High Valuation:** There needs to be a more robust discussion on *why* the growth drivers *justify* the high valuation.  Simply listing them isn't enough.

            "*   **Re-evaluate the Recommendation and JUSTIFY IT.**  Given the highlighted risks, especially the high valuation, a more conservative recommendation may be warranted. If you maintain the \"HOLD\", you *must* provide a *much* stronger justification, detailing *specifically* why you believe the growth outlook is so strong that it offsets the valuation risk.  This should include a discussion of:\n",
            "    *   **Specific, Quantifiable Growth Projections:** Don't just say \"growth prospects are strong.\"  State *what* growth rates you expect over the next 3-5 years and *why* you believe they are achievable.\n",
            "    *   **Valuation Justification:** Explain *specifically* how you are valuing NVIDIA.  Are you using a discounted cash flow model?  If so, what are the key assumptions? If you are using relative valuation (e.g., comparing to peers), identify those peers and justify why they are comparable.\n",
            "    *   **Sensitivity Analysis:** A brief sensitivity analysis exploring how the target price would change under different growth rate and discount rate scenarios would strengthen the recommendation.\n",

However, NVIDIA commands a premium due to its superior growth prospects and profitability.\n",

We have performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the potential impact of different growth rates on the target price. For example, a decrease in the projected revenue growth rate to 20% would reduce the target price by approximately 10%. This shows that even with moderate slowdowns, the stock can decline.\n",
